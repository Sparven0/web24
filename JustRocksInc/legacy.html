        <p>Donâ€™t deny it, you did it too.</p>
<p>What do we mean? Collecting cool looking rocks as a kid of course. 
Our team at <span style="font-style: italic">Just Rocks Inc</span> refuse to believe that the desire to collect rocks disappear as you get older. 
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">What have we done?</span> Well we have solved it for you! The legacy of Just Rocks Inc dates back to 2025 and Rocky Hardwell, the father of Just Rocks Inc. 
<p>He was determined to make it socially acceptable for grown-ups to collect rocks, not any rocks in specific, just rocks.
</p>
<p>He achieved this by making people acquire the rocks in the most socially acceptable way possible, by paying money for them, a lot of money.</p>
<p>If you have never heard of Just Rocks Inc, you're not unique. A big part of ensuring a peaceful, lowkey collection of rocks by our customers,
    Just Rocks Inc have decided to not use any form of marketing. We want our customers to find us through their own desires, not through posters 
    at the bus-station.
</p>
<p>To this day the legacy of Rocky Hardwell remains strong through-out the organization-culture and we continue to provide the grown-up population with very un-special normal
     rocks, at high prices!</p>
